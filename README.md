# Ethereum-gas-price-2020

In this repository I'll land my analysis about Ethereum. 
Ethereum it's a cryptocurrency, the most famous after BitCoin. Like its bigger brother Ethereum operates via blockchain and has a pletora of different stats and trends that are nice to investigate.

## Why it's interesting to investigate this topic?

Inflaction it's behind the corner. With rich countries injecting money in their economy at a continuous pace and reaching the end of the pandemic we expect a spike in price differential, so currency is going to lose a lot of its current purchase value. Use a simple macroeconomic model such as BB-MM-ESBP and you'll se what happens to the BB/MM curve when inflaction rise up. Don't want to bore you with this topic (if you feel to talk about them send me a message, I'm always interested in talking about macroeconomic stuff!).
Cryptocurrency it's a store of value and it's good for diverging a portfolio especially in this kind of times, Ethereum it's the second most notable of the group behind BitCoin.
