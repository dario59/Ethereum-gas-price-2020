## What's more interesting than a bunch of random curiosity about gas price?

Exploring the dataset about Ethereum in bigquery we can find some interesting facts about the cryptocurrency behaviour during last year.

Open bigquery and try to execute this:

```{mysql eval=FALSE}
SELECT
EXTRACT(MONTH FROM block_timestamp) as max_price_month,
EXTRACT(HOUR FROM block_timestamp) as max_price_hour
FROM `bigquery-public-data.crypto_ethereum.transactions`
WHERE gas_price = (
  SELECT
  MAX(gas_price) AS max_price,
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.crypto_ethereum.transactions`
  WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM block_timestamp) = 2020
)
```

It's a query that gives us the max value who were transferred and in which hour it was done. Given the facts we already investigate in Ethereum_gas_price_2020 (you can find it in this repository)
one would expect to find this kind of value in July or August and between 22-24 pm (UTC), instead
